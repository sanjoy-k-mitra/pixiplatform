The plugin enforces the following restrictions on authorization request params:

{table}
*Property*                                  |   *Default Value* |   *Meaning*
authorization.requireRegisteredRedirectUri  |   @true@          |   Whether a client is required to have registered a redirect URI before performing an authorization request. This addresses _RFC 6749 Section 10.6: Authorization Code Redirection URI Manipulation_ and _RFC 6749 Section 10.15: Open Redirectors_.
authorization.requireScope                  |   @true@          |   Whether the scope for each access token requested is required.
