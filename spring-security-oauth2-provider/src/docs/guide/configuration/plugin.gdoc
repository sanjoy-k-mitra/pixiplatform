The following properties define whether the plugin is active and where the required filters are registered in the Spring Security filter chain:

{table}
*Property*                              |   *Default Value*                                             |   *Meaning*
active                                  |   @true@                                                      |   Whether the plugin is enabled.
filterStartPosition                     |   @SecurityFilterPosition.X509_FILTER.order@                  |   The position in the filter chain of the @OAuth2AuthenticationProcessingFilter@, which handles authentication for resource access by extracting an access token from the incoming request.
clientFilterStartPosition               |   @SecurityFilterPosition.DIGEST_AUTH_FILTER.order@           |   The position in the filter chain of the @ClientCredentialsTokenEndpointFilter@, which handles client authentication.
statelessFilterStartPosition            |   @SecurityFilterPosition.SECURITY_CONTEXT_FILTER.order@      |   The position in the filter chain of the @StatelessSecurityContextPersistenceFilter@, which is used to ensure access to OAuth 2.0 resources and the token endpoint are stateless.
exceptionTranslationFilterStartPosition |   @SecurityFilterPosition.EXCEPTION_TRANSLATION_FILTER.order@ |   The position in the filter chain of the @ExceptionTranslationFilter@ configured with a @NullRequestCache@, which is used to ensure access to OAuth 2.0 resources and the token endpoint are stateless.
basicAuthenticationFilterStartPosition  |   @SecurityFilterPosition.BASIC_AUTH_FILTER.order@            |   The position in the filter chain of the @BasicAuthenticationFilter@ configured with a @NullRememberMeServices@, which is used to ensure access to OAuth 2.0 resources and the token endpoint are stateless.
registerStatelessFilter                 |   @true@                                                      |   When this is @true@, the plugin will register the @statelessSecurityContextPersistenceFilter@ in the filter chain after the @securityContextPersistenceFilter@ provided by the Spring Security Core plugin. See [below|guide:filterChainConfig] for additional configuration of the filter chain(s) required to properly secure access to OAuth 2.0 resources.
registerExceptionTranslationFilter      |   @true@                                                      |   When this is @true@, the plugin will register the @oauth2ExceptionTranslationFilter@ in the filter chain after the @exceptionTranslationFilter@ provided by the Spring Security Core plugin. See [below|guide:filterChainConfig] for additional configuration of the filter chain(s) required to properly secure access to OAuth 2.0 resources.
registerBasicAuthenticationFilter       |   @true@                                                      |   When this is @true@, the plugin will register the @oauth2BasicAuthenticationFilter@ in the filter chain after the @basicAuthenticationFilter@ provided by the Spring Security Core plugin. See [below|guide:filterChainConfig] for additional configuration of the filter chain(s) required to properly secure access to OAuth 2.0 resources.
realmName                               |   @Grails OAuth2 Realm@                                       |   Realm name included in the WWW-Authenticate header in a challenge response.
