At this point your application is a proper OAuth 2.0 provider. You can now register clients in what ever method is appropriate for your application. For example, you can register a client in @grails-app/init/Bootstrap.groovy@ as follows:

{code}
	def init = { servletContext ->
        new Client(
                clientId: 'my-client',
                authorizedGrantTypes: ['authorization_code', 'refresh_token', 'implicit', 'password', 'client_credentials'],
                authorities: ['ROLE_CLIENT'],
                scopes: ['read', 'write'],
                redirectUris: ['http://myredirect.com']
        ).save(flush: true)
    }
{code}
