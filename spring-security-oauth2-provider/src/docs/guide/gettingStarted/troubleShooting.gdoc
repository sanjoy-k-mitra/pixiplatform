If an instance of one of the GORM backed classes that the plugin uses cannot be saved, an @OAuth2ValidationException@ will be thrown. This is a subclass of the standard Grails @ValidationException@ so the plugin consumer has the flexibility to determine how to deal with this type of error. The typical reason for this exception being thrown will likely be related to the max size allotted to the serialized @OAuth2Authentication@ fields. The thrown exception can be inspected for further information about the @Errors@.
