Update the Core plugin's rules for the authorization and token endpoints so they are protected by Spring Security. If you're using the Core plugin's @staticRules@, you'll want to add the following in @grails-app/conf/application.groovy@:

{code}
grails.plugin.springsecurity.controllerAnnotations.staticRules = [
        [pattern: '/oauth/authorize',           access: "isFullyAuthenticated() and (request.getMethod().equals('GET') or request.getMethod().equals('POST'))"],
        [pattern: '/oauth/token',               access: "isFullyAuthenticated() and request.getMethod().equals('POST')"],
        ...
{code}

The endpoints are standard Spring MVC controllers in the underlying Spring Security OAuth2 implementations and the URLs must be mapped with @.dispatch@.

The additional restrictions on the allowed HTTP methods are to ensure compliance with the OAuth 2.0 spec as defined in [RFC 6749|http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749].
